Macron is a leading global athletic wear brand. They required a new B2B module to make it easier for the clients to place bulk orders. The team approach was to start with a wireframe and later introduce colored theme. I worked on the following during the wireframe phase.

## About the Project:

1. **Theme:** Project was based on React frontend with scandipwa theme
1. **Features:** Required new features such as shipments tracking, patch lists, erp tools and design for each.
1. **Improve:** Like any Magento site, 3rd party modules are important to improve the functionality of the website.
