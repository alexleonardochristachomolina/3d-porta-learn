Läderach is a premium swiss chocolate brand. The company has been producing premium chocolate since 3 generations. I got the opportunity to work on this project during my time at Scandiweb.
They required a website redesign and feature improvements.

I worked with a team of 8 DEV, 2 QA & 2 PM over period of 2months.

## About the Project:

1. **Stores:** Läderach now has over 8 store configurations and the web content is organized according to region and inventory.
1. **Theme:** The project had 2 themes dedicated for different areas of the website, one with SASS, other with Tailwind.
1. **Features:** Required new features such as checkout, newsletter management, marketing tools and design for each.
1. **Improve:** Like any Magento site, 3rd party modules are important to improve the functionality of the website.
1. **Bug Fixes:** Improve the experience for over 100k daily users of the website, and the admin team of the company.
